            Some boxes include a blank option. Selecting this option will make it match anything for that column, instead of a specific value. This means that leaving all rows blank in a delete statement will delete the entire relation, so be careful. The database is set to CASCADE deletions, so, for example, if you delete a Developer, then all Games that refer to that Developer will also be deleted.
